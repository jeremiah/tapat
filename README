App-Test-Tapat (Tapat)
 
This is the README file for App-Test-Tapat. Tapat is an automated
testing framework, or test harness, which uses the TAP protocol. (More
on the TAP protocol at http://testanything.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page.) 
This document is the starting point for all things Tapat.
 
INSTALLATION
 
To install this module, run the following commands:
 
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
 
Or, alternatively, you can use the deb package I have built. I recommend this method of 
installation, at least if you are using debian or one of its derivatives. I maintain
the package myself and try to keep it up to date along with the upstream software.
Currently it is only to be found in my debian repository, and I am not sure when I 
will submit it to debian. To use my repository, copy into your /etc/apt/sources.list
the following lines:
 
# Jeremiah Foster's deb repository:
deb http://jeremiahfoster.com:8080/apt sid main contrib non-free
deb-src http://jeremiahfoster.com:8080/apt sid main contrib non-free 
 
Now you can do an `aptitude update` and then `aptitude install libapp-test-tapat-perl 
and you should get the Tapat software along with its dependencies.
 
SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION
 
After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.
